# Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST)

This document describes GoGraph's Deterministic Simulation Testing harness:
its architecture, the invariants it enforces, the scenario catalogue, and how
to run, reproduce, replay, and shrink a failing run.

The harness lives in [`internal/sim/`](../internal/sim) with a command-line
driver in [`cmd/sim/`](../cmd/sim). It is modelled on TigerBeetle's VOPR
(Viewstamped Operation Replicator simulator), adapted from a distributed
consensus system to a single-node graph database: the fault surface here is the
Bolt protocol, the WAL/snapshot recovery path, and the ACID-commit liveness of
the engine, rather than network partitions and view changes.

For the broader production-readiness battery (shape generators, invariant
checkers, fault-injection packages, dataset loaders), see
[docs/test-battery.md](test-battery.md). For the three test layers (short /
soak / nightly), see [docs/test-layers.md](test-layers.md).

## Why deterministic simulation

A deterministic simulation drives the real engine through a long, randomised
sequence of operations and faults, where **every source of non-determinism is
seeded from a single master seed**. The entire run is therefore a pure function
of that seed: a failure found on seed *S* reproduces exactly on seed *S*, on any
machine, every time. This turns a rare, timing-dependent bug into a
deterministic, replayable, shrinkable artefact.

The engine is checked against a **correct-by-construction oracle** — an
independent shadow model of what the graph must contain — after operations and
at every crash-recovery boundary. Any divergence between the engine and the
oracle is a bug.

## Architecture

| Component | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Seed | `seed.go` | PCG-based PRNG ([`math/rand/v2`](https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand/v2)); the single source of randomness. Sub-seeds for the checker and the disk are XOR-derived so the workload draw stream is independent of check cadence and fault injection. |
| Virtual clock | `clock.go`, `internal/clock` | A 1 ms-per-tick logical clock injected into checkpoint cadence and the Bolt transaction reaper, so time-dependent behaviour is deterministic. |
| SimDisk | `disk.go`, `diskfs.go` | An in-memory faulting disk backing the WAL and the checkpoint/snapshot, with seed-driven sector-fault injection, a finite-capacity budget that injects disk-full (`ENOSPC`) on the WAL append+sync path, and a `Crash()` that revokes not-yet-`fsync`-ed directory entries. |
| GraphOracle | `oracle.go` | The shadow model: a minimal, obviously-correct map of the nodes and edges the engine must hold after the workload's operations. It advances only on a committed write, so it always equals the engine's durable, acknowledged state. |
| InvariantChecker | `checker.go` | Compares the engine against the oracle: count parity, sampled existence, full post-recovery durability, and index consistency. |
| Actors and workloads | `actor.go`, `workload.go` | Honest writer/reader, bounded-churn writer, malformed sender, and the concurrent-mode bad actors (Bolt abuser, overload actor, slow consumer, schema changer). A workload is a weighted mix of actors. |
| Simulator | `sim.go` | The single-goroutine, tick-driven safety loop: select an actor, run its operation, advance the oracle, check invariants, and (when enabled) crash and recover. |
| Search battery | `search_check.go` and `search_*.go` | Runs the `search/` algorithms and validates their answers against independent references (see [below](#the-search-algorithm-battery)). |

## Execution modes

`cmd/sim --mode` selects the harness:

- **`engine`** (default) — the single-goroutine, tick-driven safety loop over the
  real `cypher.Engine`. Fully bit-reproducible from the seed; this is the only
  mode that trace recording, scripted replay, and shrinking operate on.
- **`wire`** — drives the *real* `bolt/server` over an in-memory `net.Listener`
  (`SimListener`/`SimConn`) with a Bolt v5 client (`WireClient`), exercising the
  genuine protocol path without a TCP socket.
- **`concurrent`** — N real client goroutines over the Bolt wire; interleaving is
  not seed-controlled, so correctness is an eventual-consistency oracle plus
  `goleak`/no-panic guards rather than bit-reproducibility.
- **`liveness`** — the two-phase safety→liveness flow: after the safety phase,
  faults are healed and the harness asserts the system *converges* (all in-flight
  work drains, the oracle equals the engine) within a bounded budget, with a
  watchdog that classifies a non-converging run as resonance (deadlock/livelock)
  versus budget-exceeded.

## Determinism and reproducibility

Determinism is a **load-bearing invariant** of the harness, not a nicety: it is
what makes a failure replayable and shrinkable. The deterministic mode
guarantees that the same seed yields the same operations, the same fault
schedule, and the same verdict. Concretely:

- All randomness flows from one `Seed`; the checker and disk draw from
  XOR-derived sub-seeds so changing the check cadence or fault rate never
  perturbs the workload.
- No Go map-iteration order is ever allowed to influence an operation, a check
  result, or a violation message. Accessors that feed seed-driven choices sort
  their output first.
- The search battery uses integer-valued weights so its comparisons are exact;
  the only floating-point comparisons (centrality, PageRank) use an explicit
  epsilon with a pinned worker count, because a parallel float reduction is not
  bit-identical.

## Invariants checked

The `InvariantChecker` (`checker.go`) classifies every breach with a typed
`ViolationKind`:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ACID_ATOMICITY` | A write applied partially, or uncommitted state leaked in at a crash boundary. |
| `ACID_CONSISTENCY` | The engine disagrees with the oracle's node/edge counts, or an index disagrees with its base data. |
| `ACID_ISOLATION` | A reader observed the partial writes of an in-flight transaction. |
| `ACID_DURABILITY` | A committed operation did not survive crash recovery. |
| `GRAPH_INTEGRITY` | A structural invariant broke (e.g. an edge with a missing endpoint, or the engine graph diverging from the model). |
| `ORACLE_DEVIATION` | An engine/oracle disagreement not more specifically classified. |
| `SEARCH_DIVERGENCE` | A `search/` algorithm disagreed with its independent reference. |

The base checks are: node- and edge-count parity; sampled existence of oracle
nodes and edges in the engine; a full (non-sampled) durability scan at every
crash boundary; and a thorough index-consistency check that cross-checks the
index-seek path against a full scan.

## The search-algorithm battery

The `search/` package — traversal, path-finding, and analytics — is the
module's headline capability. `CheckSearch` (`search_check.go`) brings it under
the DST. It runs only in the single-goroutine deterministic loop (it needs a
quiescent view of the graph) and performs two independent families of check.

**1. Structural parity.** The engine's full node-set and `(src,dst)` edge-set are
extracted via the *public Cypher read path* — the same path the workload uses,
so no engine-internals API is added — and compared exactly to the oracle's
shadow model. This is strictly stronger than the base checker's count-plus-sample
probes: it proves the engine graph is identical to the model, which lets the
algorithm checks run on the model as a faithful stand-in for the engine's
contents.

**2. Algorithm correctness.** Each `search/` algorithm is run on the graph and
its answer is compared to an **independent naive reference** computed directly
from the oracle's edge set — never from the data structure handed to `search/`,
so a builder bug cannot hide. The cardinal rule is to **compare an invariant of
the answer, never a non-unique witness**:

| Family | Algorithms | Comparison invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Reachability | BFS, DFS | The reachable **set** from a source (order-independent). |
| Components | WCC | The partition, **up to relabelling**. |
| Strong connectivity | Tarjan SCC | The partition, up to relabelling (double-reachability reference). |
| Ordering | topological sort | *Validated* as a valid order (every edge forward; a permutation of the edge-incident nodes), since the order is not unique; cyclic graphs must return `ErrCycle`. |
| Closure | transitive closure | Per-pair reachability over edge-incident nodes. |
| SSSP / APSP | Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, bidirectional Dijkstra, A\*, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson, Dijkstra-APSP | The **distance map**, not path identity; serial and parallel variants must agree exactly. |
| MST | Kruskal, Prim | The **total weight** plus spanning-forest validity, not the edge set. |
| Flow | max-flow (Dinic), Edmonds-Karp, Stoer-Wagner | The flow **value** / cut **weight**, with max-flow = min-cut as a second invariant. |
| Matching | Hopcroft-Karp, Hungarian | Matching **cardinality** / assignment **total cost**, not the matching itself. |
| Euler | Hierholzer | *Validated* circuit (uses every edge once, closed); non-Eulerian graphs must return `ErrNoEulerian`. |
| Centrality | betweenness (parallel, weighted) | Per-node value within an epsilon, against a from-definition Brandes reference, with a pinned worker count. |
| PageRank | PageRank | The rank vector within a convergence-aware epsilon, against an independent power-iteration reference matching the damping, dangling-mass redistribution, and teleport model. |
| Community | Leiden, label propagation | Determinism, partition validity, and **no planted clique is split** (a merge is legitimate — the modularity resolution limit), not exact recovery. |
| Cohesion | k-core, biconnected components | Per-node coreness; the articulation-point and bridge sets, against remove-and-recount references. |
| K-shortest | Yen, bounded loopless, Eppstein | The **sorted cost multiset** of the first *k* paths, against a brute-force simple-path enumeration; the loopless worst case is bounded via `MaxPops`. |

Weights for the weighted algorithms are synthesised deterministically per edge,
so the algorithm checks need no change to the workload or the engine's stored
data; the families that need a specific shape (flow networks, bipartite graphs,
Eulerian graphs) generate their own deterministic fixtures from the tick.

The `search` scenario runs this battery periodically and at the end of a run;
the `search-crash` scenario additionally runs it immediately after every
crash-recovery cycle, so the algorithms are validated against a graph that has
actually survived WAL recovery — the DST-unique value for `search/`.

## Scenario catalogue

A scenario is a named, self-contained configuration (seed, workload, fault
schedule, budget, mode, checks). `cmd/sim --list-scenarios` prints them.

| Scenario | Mode | Stresses |
|---|---|---|
| `crash-storm` | deterministic | Frequent crash + recovery via the SimDisk WAL path (durability). |
| `disk-full` | deterministic | Honest writes against a finite SimDisk: `ENOSPC` on the WAL append+sync path plus crash/recovery. Asserts atomic fail-stop durability — a commit that cannot durably write never advances the oracle, and after recovery no acknowledged commit is lost and no uncommitted state leaks in. |
| `write-heavy` | deterministic | 80/20 write/read; the write path and oracle parity. |
| `read-heavy` | deterministic | 20/80 write/read; the read path and isolation. |
| `schema-chaos` | deterministic | Index create/drop/re-create under write load + full index-consistency check. |
| `constraint-enforce` | deterministic | UNIQUE(Person.name) enforcement: duplicate-name CREATEs must be rejected with a typed constraint-violation error (the oracle predicts each accept/reject and the harness flags any disagreement as an enforcement gap), and the constraint must survive crash/recovery still enforcing. |
| `type-coverage` | deterministic | Property type system: nodes carry a value of every round-tripping Cypher kind (string, integer, float, boolean, list, ISO-8601 temporal) plus a never-set key that must read `NULL`. Each value is read back through the engine and compared to the oracle via the canonical typed rendering, and re-checked immediately after crash/recovery — so every kind is proven to round-trip and survive WAL recovery. |
| `edge-properties` | deterministic | Edge properties: KNOWS edges carry a `since` (ISO string) and `weight` (float); each is read back through the Cypher path (exercising the columnar edge-property tier) and compared to the oracle, periodically and after each crash/recovery, proving edge properties round-trip and survive WAL recovery. |
| `index-diversity` | deterministic | Index-type diversity: a HASH (string), a BTREE (numeric), and a BTREE (string) index are created over an above-threshold graph (engaging the morsel-parallel backfill phase), then write churn + crash/recovery run while the thorough seek-vs-scan consistency check confirms each index agrees with its base data — for both kinds and both value types, including after WAL recovery re-registers and re-backfills them. |
| `search` | deterministic | The `search/` algorithm battery over the live graph + structural parity. |
| `cypher-paths` | deterministic | The Cypher-level `shortestPath()` operator: its hop count is compared to an independent BFS over the oracle's KNOWS edges for a bounded, deterministic set of pairs (comparing the path-length invariant, never a specific witness), periodically and after each crash/recovery. |
| `cypher-surface` | deterministic | A battery of diverse read shapes — `count`/`sum` aggregation, `WHERE`, `WITH…WHERE`, pattern-count, `OPTIONAL MATCH`, `UNWIND range()`, and `ORDER BY` — is run against independently-computed oracle invariants (scalar values and the sorted-name sequence), broadening the DST's coverage of the Cypher read surface beyond the per-tick parity probe, including after crash/recovery. |
| `search-crash` | deterministic | The `search/` battery validated on the crash + recovery-survived graph. |
| `mem-pressure` | deterministic | Over-budget reads (large `UNWIND`, Cartesian, whole-graph `collect`) against clamped logical-resource budgets (`MaxResultRows`/`MaxCollectItems`). Asserts bounded-resource graceful degradation: each over-budget read is refused with a typed error and changes no state, so engine and oracle stay in lock-step and the honest writes still commit — no panic, no partial result, no wedge. A soak-gated companion (`TestMemPressure_Soak`) imposes a real heap ceiling via `debug.SetMemoryLimit` and drives an overload-heavy concurrent wire workload, asserting the same degrade-never-panic contract under genuine GC pressure. |
| `bad-actors` | deterministic | 100% malformed/abuse workload; every op rejected with a typed error, no state change. |
| `overload` | concurrent | Giant transactions / huge `UNWIND` / large result sets / deep variable-length expansion; bounded-resource graceful degradation. |
| `cpu-starvation` | liveness | A compute-hog workload (60% overload) competing with honest queries on a single clamped `GOMAXPROCS` core, then a liveness convergence assertion. Verifies fair scheduling under CPU starvation: the system keeps making forward progress (no deadlock/livelock — the watchdog classifies a stuck run as resonance), no panic, no goroutine leak. Latency percentiles are deliberately not asserted (statistical). |
| `bulk-vs-online` | bulk-vs-online | A concurrent offline bulk CSR load alongside transactional online writes; resource stability. |
| `long-running` | deterministic | Millions of small bounded-churn ops; oracle parity plus heap/goroutine stability (soak). |

## Crash and recovery

When a scenario enables crashes, the simulator drives a real SimDisk-backed
persistence stack. A scheduled crash is a SIGKILL-equivalent: the live engine
is dropped *without* a graceful close, so any buffered-but-unsynced frame is
lost exactly as a real crash would lose it, while the durable byte image in the
SimDisk survives. The store is then reopened through the real recovery path
(WAL replay, and snapshot promotion where a checkpoint was published), and:

- the **durability check** verifies every acknowledged-committed operation
  survived and nothing uncommitted leaked in; and
- when the search battery is enabled, the **full search battery** runs on the
  recovered graph, so the algorithms are exercised against crash-survived state.

A recovery that detects genuine corruption fails stop (a typed error), which the
run surfaces rather than swallowing.

### Snapshot + WAL-tail crash recovery

Beyond the WAL-only path, the harness exercises the **snapshot + WAL-tail**
recovery on the live engine: a self-sufficient snapshot of the committed state is
published to the SimDisk, further commits append to the WAL tail, and a crash
drops the in-memory engine. Recovery through `recovery.OpenFS` promotes the last
fully-published snapshot and folds the WAL tail back, reconstructing the exact
committed state (`internal/sim/checkpoint_crash_test.go` — both the
snapshot+tail and snapshot-only arms). The durability-ordering boundary itself
(snapshot published *before* the WAL prefix is truncated, crash mid-publish drops
the staging dirents and the full WAL replays) is proven at the component level in
`disk_fullstack_test.go` / `disk_checkpoint_test.go`.

A *Checkpointer-driven* checkpoint (which additionally truncates the WAL prefix
via `wal.Writer.TruncatePrefix`) is not yet wired into the live SimDisk stack:
that truncation requires a path-backed WAL writer, while the SimDisk WAL is
handle-backed. Closing that gap needs a WAL filesystem seam and is tracked
separately; the recovery fold it would feed is already covered by the tests
above.

## Disk exhaustion (ENOSPC)

`SimDisk` carries an optional byte budget (`SetCapacity`, surfaced as
`DiskConfig` on a scenario). When set, a WAL append or checkpoint write that
would grow the disk past the budget returns an `ENOSPC` `os.PathError` on the
*real* WAL append+sync path — either eagerly at the growing `Write` or, in
delayed-allocation mode, at the covering `Sync` (the harder commit boundary).
The budget check is a pure function of the byte total and draws nothing from the
seed, so it never perturbs the reproducible fault stream.

The `disk-full` scenario drives the honest write workload against a finite disk
with crash/recovery on top, asserting the engine's ACID contract under
exhaustion: a commit that cannot durably write fails atomically (the oracle
advances only on a committed write, so engine and oracle stay in lock-step), the
WAL writer fail-stops, and after recovery the durability check confirms no
acknowledged commit was lost (`ACID_DURABILITY`) and no uncommitted state leaked
in (`ACID_ATOMICITY`).

This scenario found a real ACID bug on first run: on a simple (non-multigraph)
graph, re-`CREATE`ing an already-existing edge is a storage no-op, but the
in-memory undo log recorded a `RemoveEdge` inverse, so rolling the transaction
back (here via an `ENOSPC` WAL sync, but any rollback triggers it) deleted the
pre-existing committed edge. The fix gates the edge bookkeeping on whether the
edge was actually added.

## Read-only transaction isolation

The `BeginReadTx` read-only transaction is covered by two focused tests in
`internal/sim/` (`read_tx_test.go`):

- **Write rejection.** Every writing/DDL statement issued inside a read-only
  transaction is rejected with the typed `cypher.ErrWriteInReadOnlyTx` and
  applies nothing, while reads continue to work.
- **No dirty reads.** A writer commits nodes in atomic batches of five while many
  concurrent read-only transactions repeatedly count them; the engine's
  visibility barrier flips each transaction's writes visible as one step, so
  every observed count is a multiple of five — observing an intermediate value
  would be a partial-transaction (dirty) read across the isolation barrier. The
  test is `-race`- and `goleak`-guarded with a deadlock watchdog.

## Concurrency hypotheses chased

The mem-pressure and cpu-starvation scenarios are backed by two focused
concurrent regression tests in `cypher/` that chase specific
fair-scheduling / barrier hypotheses, each under a deadlock watchdog:

- **Aggregator cap inside the write barrier.** Many concurrent aggregating
  writes that trip `MaxCollectItems` *inside* the visibility barrier run
  alongside honest reads and writes. The error path releases the barrier on
  every iteration (no held-`visMu` deadlock), and the engine stays usable —
  evidence the in-barrier error path is leak-free.
- **Parallel CREATE INDEX backfill.** An above-threshold parallel backfill runs
  concurrently with honest readers. The backfill scan runs *before* registration
  and *outside* the visibility barrier (a reader's plan build sees either no
  index or a fully populated one), so readers are never blocked by a held
  barrier; the test asserts forward progress (no deadlock, no wedge) rather than
  interleaving, which is statistical. Neither hypothesis was a real defect.

## Swarm, coverage, and cross-checking modes

- **Swarm** (`--swarm`) runs many seeds across a bounded worker pool, time- or
  count-boxed, and reports pass/fail counts plus a reproduction command per
  failure.
- **Coverage** (`--coverage-report`, `--bias`) tracks which scenarios have been
  exercised and can bias selection toward under-covered ones.
- **Differential**, **upgrade**, **cross-release**, and **metrics-oracle** modes
  cross-check equivalent engine configurations, WAL data-compatibility across
  releases, and metrics against the oracle. See the corresponding `*_test.go`
  files in `internal/sim/`. The differential variant pairs prove that
  result-equivalent engine toggles produce byte-identical observable output on
  the same trace: `DefaultVariantPair` (hash-join on/off), `RangeSeekVariantPair`
  (range index seek on/off), and `ParallelScanVariantPair` (the morsel-parallel
  count reduce versus the serial path) — the last brings the engine's
  multithread/parallel count path under the DST. The serial-vs-parallel CREATE
  INDEX backfill is proven content-identical at the engine level
  (`cypher.TestBackfillNodeHashIndex_SerialVsParallelIdentical`, via
  `EngineOptions.DisableParallelBackfill`), since a backfill engages its parallel
  phase only above 8192 nodes — more than a scripted trace builds.

## Command-line usage

```bash
# Build the simulator.
go build ./cmd/sim

# Run a single deterministic simulation (seed is a leading positional argument).
go run ./cmd/sim 42 --ticks=100000

# List the scenario catalogue.
go run ./cmd/sim --list-scenarios

# Run a named scenario (note the '=' form — a bare token is parsed as the seed).
go run ./cmd/sim --scenario=search
go run ./cmd/sim --scenario=search-crash 12345

# Run a swarm of seeds, time- or count-boxed.
go run ./cmd/sim --scenario=search --swarm --runs=200
go run ./cmd/sim --swarm --duration=30s --coverage-report

# Drive the real Bolt wire / concurrent / liveness harnesses.
go run ./cmd/sim --mode=wire
go run ./cmd/sim --mode=concurrent --conns=16 --ops-per-conn=25

# Inject deterministic crash + recovery cycles.
go run ./cmd/sim 7 --crashes
```

Flags of note: `--workload` (`default|write-heavy|read-heavy|bad-actor`),
`--check-every` (invariant-check cadence), `--verbose` (print each operation),
and `--replay` (see below).

## Reproduce, replay, and shrink

Every failing run prints a `Reproduce with: go run ./cmd/sim <seed>` line.
Because the deterministic mode is a pure function of the seed, re-running that
command reproduces the failure exactly.

`--replay` re-runs the seed in verbose, full-trace debug; on a violation it
applies delta-debugging (`ddmin`) to shrink the operation trace to a minimal
reproducer — the smallest sub-sequence of operations that still triggers the
violation — which is what you attach to a bug report.

## Extending the harness

- **A new invariant check** is a function returning `[]Violation`; wire it into
  the checker or into `CheckSearch` and give it a typed `ViolationKind`.
- **A new search algorithm check** follows the pattern in `search_*.go`: build
  the input (from the live graph or a deterministic shaped fixture), run the
  algorithm, compute an **independent** reference, and compare an **invariant**
  of the answer (never a non-unique witness). Add the call to `CheckSearch`.
- **A new scenario** is a `Scenario` value registered in `DefaultRegistry`
  (`catalogue.go`); it is then automatically available to `--scenario`,
  `--list-scenarios`, `--swarm`, and the coverage report.
- **A new actor** implements the `Actor` interface (`actor.go`) and is added to a
  workload mix; the oracle must model its operations so engine and model stay in
  lock-step.

All new code must preserve bit-reproducibility (no map-iteration order in any
output) and must keep the full suite green under `go test -race ./internal/sim
./cmd/sim`.
