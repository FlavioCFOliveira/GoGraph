# GoGraph memory-usage audit — 2026-06-19

**Type.** Read-only empirical audit. Nothing in this document has been
implemented; the findings are filed as `rmp` backlog (sprint 221, tasks
1628–1633) for a later implementation cycle.

**Goal.** A detailed Go memory audit of the module, gathering empirical evidence
by exercising the 26 examples across diverse scenarios, to identify
efficiency (resident-RAM and allocation/GC) improvement opportunities.

**Environment.** 10-core / 32 GiB Apple M4, go1.26.4, branch `main @ ea36227`
(includes the prior memory-audit merge `049706f`, sprints S205–S210).

**Method.**

1. Built all 26 example binaries; ran each at a representative scale, capturing
   the examples' own post-GC live-heap telemetry (`# mem.heap_alloc`,
   `# mem.heap_growth`, `# bytes_per_node|edge`, `# *.mallocs`) and process peak
   RSS via `/usr/bin/time -l`.
2. Attributed the two standout consumers (ex02 LPG-with-indexes, ex22 Cypher)
   with `go tool pprof` `alloc_space` profiles, via temporary in-package
   benchmark harnesses that call the real `run()` (removed after profiling).
3. Cross-checked every structural finding against source and had three
   specialists certify the designs — columnar-db-expert (layout), go-developer
   (Go idiom + exact call-site surface), storage-engine-auditor
   (durability/on-disk-format safety) — per the project's measure-to-decide and
   specialist-consultation mandates.

## 1. Empirical sweep — where memory goes, by scenario

Live heap = post-GC reachable bytes (each example's own `readMem()`); RSS = peak
process resident set. Superlinear algorithms (exact Brandes, Hungarian,
max-flow, Yen) were run at moderate scale — their interest is transient
allocations, not resident heap.

| Ex | Scenario / dominant structure | Scale | live heap | per-element | peak RSS |
|----|-------------------------------|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **22** | **Cypher engine** (scan/order/where/rel/create) | 200k users, 900k edges | **483.8 MiB** | — | **1276 MB** |
| **26** | **LPG social + Cypher**, dated edges | 200k users, ~13M edges | (build ~287 MiB¹) | **446.1 B/edge** | **>6.5 GB queries** |
| **02** | **LPG + schema + 2 indexes** | 300k persons, 300k edges | 227.6 MiB | **786.9 B/node** | 332 MB |
| 01 | CSR Dijkstra (RGG), in-memory build | 300k nodes | 214.3 MiB | — | 562 MB |
| 06 | CSV/JSONL round-trip over an LPG | 150k users | 192.2 MiB | 52 B/edge CSV | 462 MB |
| 19 | LPG fluent pattern query | 200k pkgs, 800k edges | 153.9 MiB | ~190 B/elem | 264 MB |
| 05 | csrfile mmap, semi-external PageRank | 500k nodes, 4M edges | 38.4 MiB | — | 328 MB |
| 12 | CSR DAG (TopSort / Tarjan) | 200k mod, 375k edges | 36.8 MiB | — | 87 MB |
| 08 | CSR PageRank (directed scale-free) | 500k pages | 26.9 MiB | — | 346 MB |
| 20 | frozen CSR, lock-free concurrent reads | 200k nodes, 1.6M edges | 26.2 MiB | ~14 B/edge | 384 MB |
| 17 | WAL ledger + checkpoint + recovery | 3k acct, 15k xfer | small | — | 37 MB |
| 18 | OOC pipeline CSV→CSR→csrfile→mmap | 400k nodes, 3.2M edges | 3.3 MiB | (disk 55 MiB) | 530 MB |

¹ ex26 build heap from the 2026-06-19 re-measurement; the multi-GB figure
observed today is the Cypher **query** phase on the 200k-user graph, not the
build. The 446.1 B/edge reflects the mandatory dated edge properties.

Examples not tabulated were either already characterised in batch 1 or hit a
generator pre-condition under the chosen scale knobs (e.g. ex11 needs
`bridges ≥ communities−1`) — none change the conclusions below. ex07
(GraphML round-trip) is **CPU-, not memory-bound**: ~67 MB RSS but minutes of
CPU at 80k nodes/400k edges — recorded as an out-of-scope CPU-efficiency
observation, not a memory finding.

### 1.1 Reading
The cost is **not** in the immutable or out-of-core path: a frozen CSR sits at
the textbook floor (~14 B/edge, ex20; ex08/12 tens of MiB for half a million
elements) and `csrfile` mmap holds heap to single-digit MiB regardless of graph
size (ex05/18). Persistence heap is small (ex17). The resident and allocation
cost concentrates in the **mutable labelled-property graph** (ex02:
786.9 B/node; ex26: 446 B/edge) and the **Cypher query path** (ex22/26, peak RSS
2.6–20× the resident heap). Every opportunity below lives there.

## 2. Ranked opportunities

The prior (2026-06-18) audit was ex26-centric and shipped S205 (edge-**label**
inline column), S206 (index `NodeSet` small tier), S207 (node `propBag` small
tier), S208 (Cypher **node** lazy-materialisation), S209 (search transients),
S210 (snapshot CSR codec). It left three *sibling* structures un-tiered and the
relationship value eager. All findings below are NEW relative to that work and
are profile-confirmed.

### F2 — Edge properties: un-tiered per-edge nested map ★ do first  (rmp #1628)
- **Evidence.** `graph/lpg/lpg.go:163` `edgePropShard.m map[edgeKey]map[PropertyKeyID]PropertyValue`;
  per-edge allocation at `graph/lpg/edge_property.go:25`. **Largest single
  allocation site in ex22: `SetEdgeProperty` 212 MB / 16.8%.** ex26's dated
  edges measure 446 B/edge.
- **Fix.** Reuse `propBag` **verbatim** → `map[edgeKey]propBag`, with the
  by-value read-modify-**write-back** idiom under the shard lock. ≈348 → ≈80
  B/edge (~4×).
- **Certification.** storage-engine-auditor: format-neutral and ACID-safe —
  serialization reads through the public `EdgeProperties()` accessor (logical,
  not in-memory-order), `propertiesFormatVersion` stays `1`, no migration. The
  write-back line is load-bearing (omitting it = lost update).
- **Leverage.** Highest, lowest effort; edges typically outnumber nodes, so by
  total bytes it beats F1, and it reuses already-audited code.

### F1 — Node labels: un-tiered per-node map ★ do second  (rmp #1629)
- **Evidence.** `graph/lpg/lpg.go:155` `nodeLabelShard.m map[graph.NodeID]map[LabelID]struct{}`;
  per-node allocation `lpg.go:1153` `make(map[LabelID]struct{})`. ex02 profile:
  **`SetNodeLabel` cum 27.9 MB / 21.9%** of build allocations (~166 B/node).
- **Fix.** New **unexported** `labelBag` tiered union (singleton / small
  `[]LabelID` / map; threshold 8), mirroring `NodeSet` but value-less; label
  order is unobservable. ≈300 → ≈34 B/node (~9×).
- **Risk.** go-developer enumerated the full surface (8 `nodeLabelShardFor`
  methods in `lpg.go` + `introspect.go`). One real hazard: keep the `nodeIdx`
  label-bitmap (`lpg.go:1158`) in lockstep with the bag, plus the tombstone
  strip/restore path — add a dedicated regression test. No on-disk/TCK change.
  Keep the type unexported (the concurrencydoc ratchet fires only on exported
  types).

### F4a — Cypher relationship values are never lazy-ified ★ compounds with F2  (rmp #1630)
- **Evidence.** `cypher/api.go:7419` `buildRelationshipValueFromRow`
  **unconditionally** calls `g.EdgeProperties` (+ `EdgeLabels` +
  `buildEdgeTypeFilter`) to materialise every matched edge's full property/type
  map per row — whether or not the query reads it. ex22 query profile:
  `buildRelationshipValueFromRow` cum **384 MB / 30%**, `EdgeProperties` 190 MB,
  `buildEdgeTypeFilter` 146 MB; the umbrella `populateRowCtx` is cum 632 MB
  (50%) and `exec.(*Project).Next` cum 689 MB (54.6%). Nodes were made lazy in
  S208 (`LazyNodeValue`, `api.go:6876`, now only 20 MB); relationships were not.
- **Fix.** A `LazyRelationshipValue` mirroring `LazyNodeValue`: carry the edge id
  + endpoints + a resolver, defer `EdgeProperties`/`EdgeLabels` until a property
  or type is actually accessed. Compounds with F2 (cheaper materialisation when
  it does occur).
- **Risk.** cypher-expert review of deleted-entity and per-instance-label
  (multigraph) semantics — S208 preserved these for nodes; the relationship path
  must too. TCK-sensitive → re-verify 3897.

### F3 — `PropertyValue` boxes every scalar in `any` ◇ gate hard, may abandon  (rmp #1631)
- **Evidence.** `graph/lpg/property.go:39` `struct { kind PropertyKind; v any }`.
  Every int64/float64/bool is boxed → a heap word per scalar + GC scan pressure,
  on node *and* edge properties (ex02 `StringValue`/`Float64Value` ~5.3 MB;
  pervasive).
- **Fix.** `{ kind; num uint64; ref any }` — scalars packed in `num`,
  strings/lists behind `ref`. Internal-only (`.v` is read only inside
  `property.go`; the struct fields are unexported).
- **Caveat (both columnar-db-expert and go-developer concur).** The resident win
  is **~neutral** (the +8 B struct growth ≈ the saved scalar box). The real win
  is **allocation count + GC scan** (scalar values become pointer-free). Decide
  by `-benchmem` + `GODEBUG=gctrace=1`, NOT resident bytes. A NaN/−0.0
  bit-exactness round-trip test is mandatory (TCK NaN-equivalence paths). **Ship
  only on unambiguous benchstat evidence; otherwise record the numbers and
  abandon.**

### #1597 — `csrfile/writer.go` widening copy ★ confirmed still open  (rmp #1632)
- **Evidence.** `store/csrfile/writer.go:131-137` allocates
  `tmp := make([]uint64, len(edges))` then widens element-by-element — but
  `graph.NodeID` *is* `uint64`, so it is a pure no-op copy of a full edge column
  (~8 B/edge) plus `binary.Write` scratch, at every bulk publish. Same defect
  S210 fixed in the snapshot codec; `csrfile` is a separate package that never
  received it. The `Reinterpret[T]` primitive to fix it already exists in-package
  (`store/csrfile/reinterpret.go:35`).
- **Risk.** Byte-identical on disk (LE host, LE format), CRC unchanged → no
  format bump, ACID-neutral. storage-engine-auditor verdict: this is the top
  remaining persistence transient lever; S210 is confirmed complete for the
  snapshot read *and* write paths.

### Follow-ons — same pathology, surfaced by the auditor  (rmp #1633)
`graph/lpg/edge_instance_props.go:19` (per-CREATE instance props) and
`graph/lpg/edge_handle.go:71`/`:65` (per-handle props *and* per-handle labels)
carry the identical un-tiered innermost map. These are the authoritative
per-instance surface in **multigraph** mode, so for parallel-edge-heavy graphs
they can dominate the per-pair store F2 targets. Apply `propBag`/`labelBag`
there too.

### Re-validated still-open backlog
- **#1596** — 16-byte `unsafe` `NodeSet` union (~5.1× over the current ~48 B
  value). Minor for low-cardinality indexes (ex02), material for high-cardinality
  unique `{id}` indexes (ex19/26).

## 3. Higher-ceiling direction (separate initiative)
For this build-once-query-many graph, columnar-db-expert recommends the
C-Store / Vertica **read-store + write-store + compaction** pattern as the
eventual ceiling: an immutable CSR/columnar base built at checkpoint plus a
small mutable tiered-union delta overlay, compacted on checkpoint; with true
per-`(label, propKey)` columnar value storage (dictionary / RLE / FOR encoding)
as the highest tier. This breaks the schemaless property-bag model and is a
distinct initiative — F1/F2/F4a are the incremental, low-risk wins to take
first.

## 3a. Implementation results (branch perf/mem-audit-2026-06-19)

Measured on this machine (10-core M4, go1.26.4). Each fix is its own commit with
a `-benchmem`/heap-snapshot gate; TCK 3897, `go test -race`, and the full short
suite (98 packages) stay green throughout.

| Fix | Commit | Controlled harness (200k nodes / 600k edges) | Real example |
|-----|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **F2** edge-props → propBag | cd4d24d | edge-prop store **365 → 154 B/edge (−58%)**; full mix 355.4 → 229.1 MiB (−35.5%) | ex22 live heap **483.8 → 246.4 MiB (−49.1%)**, peak RSS 1276 → 747 MB (−41.5%) |
| **F1** node-labels → labelBag | c7ef402 | label store **~145 → ~72 B/node (−50%)**; labels-only 68.0 → 53.4 MiB | ex02 786.9 → 726.3 B/node, heap 227.6 → 210.1 MiB |
| **#1597** csrfile byte-views | db8a504 | — | WriteToFile 400k edges **4.26 → 1.85 MB/op (−56.6%)**, 27 → 24 allocs, −13% ns |
| **F4a** Cypher demand-gate unreferenced rels + topology direction probe | fe8bcff | — | query binding an unread property-bearing rel **3.26 → 0.47 MB/op (−85.6%)**, −67% allocs, −69% ns |
| **#1633** multigraph per-instance/per-handle stores → propBag/labelBag | 4605381 | — | format-neutral; benefits parallel-edge multigraphs (tier transitions gated) |
| **F3** PropertyValue de-box | (none) | **Deferred** — gated experiment | see below |
| **F1+F2 combined** | — | full LPG build **355.4 → 214.5 MiB (−39.6%)** | — |

All six sprint-221 tasks are COMPLETED (the sprint is closed); every change passed
go-developer review (F2/F1/F4a) and the cypher-expert review (F4a). Final gate:
gofmt/vet clean, golangci-lint 0 issues, `go test -race` green on every touched
package incl. TCK 3897, full short suite 98 packages green. One pre-existing
(not-a-regression) limitation surfaced by the F4a review — undirected multigraph
reverse-hop type fidelity — is filed as backlog #1634.

**F3 outcome (gated, rejected).** The proposed `{kind; num uint64; ref any}`
keeps the `ref` pointer in every value, so the type stays GC-scanned (no
pointer-free win) and grows 24 → 32 B. In realistic mixes Go already caches
small ints and bools (zero box on escape); only float64/large-int/string box. So
de-boxing removes ~one float64 box per scalar prop but adds +8 B to *every*
stored value → a net **resident regression** (~+24 B/node in a 5-prop/3-scalar
node) with no GC-scan benefit. Closed as measured-not-worth-it (rmp #1631); a
true win needs a fully unboxed scalar union (no `ref` for scalar kinds), tracked
separately and only if alloc/GC throughput — not resident memory — is the target.

**F4a outcome (implemented, contained).** A `LazyRelationshipValue` type was
rejected by cypher-expert design review (`PathValue` holds rels by value; ~60
consumer sites; multigraph Type is positional). The shipped design (Variant 1)
is contained: (1) `populateRowCtx` skips building the relationship value for an
edge variable the expression never names — safe because that path runs only for
non-escaping `scalarUse` expressions; (2) the stored-edge direction is now
determined by `AdjList.HasEdge` topology rather than the prior "labels AND props
both empty" heuristic, which (a) lets the property fetch be skipped without
losing the direction signal and (b) is now correct for an unlabelled,
property-less reverse edge. The escaping projection path (`RETURN r`, `r.prop`)
is deliberately unchanged — still fully materialised — to preserve the
no-truncated-escaping-value invariant; per-row property reduction there was
already largely captured by F2 (ex22 peak RSS −41.5%). Result: queries that bind
a relationship without reading it drop **−85.6 % B/op**. TCK 3897 held
throughout, including Match6 undirected.

## 4. Suggested sequencing
F2 → F1 → F4a (each its own commit with a `-benchmem` gate and a heap-snapshot
harness on the ex26 generators) → #1597 (independent, trivial) → F3 (gated, may
abandon) → multigraph per-instance follow-ons → #1596.
