# Knowledge Model — GoGraph

Authoritative description of the GoGraph knowledge graph (a Label Property Graph stored
in `rmp graph`). The graph and this file **must mirror each other**: whenever a label,
edge type, or property is added or removed, update both in the same change.

- **Roadmap:** `gograph` (all commands take `-r gograph`).
- **Module:** `github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/GoGraph`.
- **Scope:** *full code graph* — every package, type, function, method, test, benchmark,
  fuzz target, and runnable example in the module, plus a curated layer of Features and
  Specs above them, a Sprint/Commit provenance layer, and a memory layer (Agent, Skill,
  Memory) that mirrors the assistant's persistent memory files.
- **Provenance:** every node **and** every edge carries `gitCommit` (full HEAD hash when the
  element was last confirmed) and `gitDate` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`).

Counts as of commit `567253c` + in-flight worktree (2026-06-11): **11,867 nodes**, **15,360 edges**.
Incrementally synced at commit `257ce96` (2026-06-14, task #1502): +4 nodes
(`NodePropertiesByIDFunc` Method, `nodePropsToExprMap` Function,
`TestNodePropertiesByIDFunc_MatchesByID` Test, `BenchmarkNodeReturnToPackstream`
Benchmark), +5 edges (4 `CONTAINS`, 1 `HAS_METHOD`).
Incrementally synced at commit `f47b18a` (2026-06-15, task #1506, sprint 190 —
hash join for disconnected equi-join patterns): +5 nodes (`Commit` `f47b18a`;
`HashJoin` Type and `NewHashJoin` Function in `cypher/exec`; `tryBuildHashJoin`
and `hashJoinOrderSafe` Functions in `cypher`), +9 edges (4 `TOUCHES` from the
commit to packages `cypher`/`exec`/`cypher_ldbc_test` and the `HashJoin` Type,
1 `FIXES` to the `Cypher Engine` Feature, 4 `CONTAINS` for the new symbols). The
optimisation is increment A of the optimizer-activation spike (task #1504,
commit `9fa521b`); the `cypher/ir/rewrite` logical Driver remains unwired.
Incrementally synced at commit `657d9ba` (2026-06-15, task #1525, sprint 190 —
result-streaming feasibility spike, DESIGN-ONLY outcome): +4 nodes (`Commit`
`657d9ba`; `Spec` `docs/result-streaming-design.md`; `Task` `1525` COMPLETED and
`Task` `1526` BACKLOG); +8 edges (`Task 1525 -[IMPLEMENTED_IN]-> Commit
657d9ba`; `Task 1525 -[DEPENDS_ON]-> Task 1526`; `Commit 657d9ba -[TOUCHES]->
Spec`; `CypherEngine` and `ACIDTransactions` Features each `-[SPECIFIED_IN]->`
the new Spec; `Task 1526 -[ABOUT]->` both Features). New edge type
`DEPENDS_ON (Task)->(Task)` introduced for the streaming-needs-foundation
dependency. Task #1526 captures the per-shard versioned `Snapshot` root
(`atomic.Pointer[Snapshot]`) foundation that SI-safe lazy result streaming
depends on. DATA-QUALITY NOTE: the `CypherEngine` (id 12659) and
`ACIDTransactions` (id 9736) Feature nodes carry a hidden interior character
(`size`=13 and 17 for the 12-/16-char visible names), so `{name:'…'}` equality
and `STARTS WITH`/`CONTAINS 'CypherEngine'` fail to bind them; match by `id(f)`
or `CONTAINS 'Cypher'`+`CONTAINS 'Engine'`. Pre-existing; not corrected here.

| `CONTAINS` | 11792 |
| `HAS_METHOD` | 3391 |
| `IMPLEMENTS` | 87 |
| `ABOUT` | 36 |

### Memory layer (hybrid, approved 2026-06-11)

The `Memory` nodes mirror the persistent memory files in the Claude Code project memory
directory — the **files remain canonical** for the harness (`MEMORY.md` is the loaded
index); the graph adds the queryable relational layer (what a memory is about, who
consults it). When a memory file is created, renamed, or deleted, the mirroring `Memory`
node must follow in the same change. `Agent` nodes are the specialist sub-agents mandated
by `CLAUDE.md`; `Skill` nodes are the project's own Claude Code skills
(`knowledge-authority`, `roadmap-manager`).

---

## Feature taxonomy

The 16 curated `Feature` nodes (a deliberately small, reviewed set — not auto-derived):

`Core Graph Model`, `Search & Path-finding`, `Persistence Backends`, `WAL & Recovery`,
`ACID Transactions`, `Cypher Engine`, `openCypher TCK Compliance`, `Bolt Protocol`,
`Data Structures`, `Benchmarking & Profiling`, `Production-Readiness Test Battery`,
`Stable Element Identity`, `Observability & Metrics`, `CLI Tooling`,
`Examples & Tutorials`, `Release & Versioning`.

### `IMPLEMENTS` mapping rules (package path → feature)

A package maps to features by its repo-relative directory prefix (a package may map to
several features):

| Path prefix | Feature(s) |
|---|---|
| `graph` | Core Graph Model |
| `search` | Search & Path-finding |
| `cypher/tck` | openCypher TCK Compliance **and** Cypher Engine |
| `cypher` (other) | Cypher Engine |
| `store/wal`, `store/recovery` | WAL & Recovery **and** ACID Transactions |
| `store/txn` | ACID Transactions |
| `store` (other) | Persistence Backends |
| `bolt` | Bolt Protocol |
| `ds` | Data Structures |
| `bench` | Benchmarking & Profiling |
| `examples/*` | Examples & Tutorials |
| `cmd`, `tools` | CLI Tooling |
| `internal/crashinject` | ACID Transactions **and** Production-Readiness Test Battery |
| `internal/testlayers` (or any `crashinject`) | Production-Readiness Test Battery |

Packages outside these prefixes (e.g. assorted `internal/*` helpers) implement no feature
and have no `IMPLEMENTS` edge — this is expected, not a defect.

### `SPECIFIED_IN` mapping (feature → spec path)

| Feature | Spec(s) |
|---|---|
| Cypher Engine | `docs/cypher.md` |
| openCypher TCK Compliance | `docs/cypher.md` |
| ACID Transactions | `docs/acid-audit.md`, `docs/isolation-design.md` |
| WAL & Recovery | `docs/persistence.md`, `docs/csrfile-v1.md` |
| Persistence Backends | `docs/persistence.md`, `docs/io.md` |
| Search & Path-finding | `docs/algorithms.md` |
| Bolt Protocol | `docs/bolt.md` |
| Benchmarking & Profiling | `docs/profiling.md`, `docs/optimisations.md` |
| Production-Readiness Test Battery | `docs/test-battery.md`, `docs/test-layers.md` |
| Stable Element Identity | `docs/maxnodeid.md` |
| Observability & Metrics | `docs/metrics.md` |
| Examples & Tutorials | `docs/examples-standard.md` |
| Release & Versioning | `docs/semver.md`, `docs/release.md` |

Some `Spec` nodes (e.g. `docs/tier2.md`) are intentionally unlinked — not every document
maps onto a feature.

## ⚠️ Guard-rail gotcha — `set`/`delete`/`remove`/`detach`

`rmp graph` enforces operation-class guard-rails by **scanning the raw Cypher text** for the
write-keywords `SET`, `DELETE`, `REMOVE`, `DETACH` (whole-word, case-insensitive). This trips
on those words appearing **inside string data** — both when writing and when reading:

- `create`/`update`/`delete` reject a query if a forbidden keyword for the wrong class
  appears anywhere, including inside a quoted literal.
- `query`/`search` reject a read whose literals contain `SET`/`DELETE`/`REMOVE`/`DETACH`
  (e.g. `WHERE m.name = 'Delete'` is rejected).

GoGraph's own source is full of such identifiers (`Delete`, `Set`, `RemoveLabel`,
`detach_delete.go`, …). **Workaround: split the keyword with Cypher string concatenation** so
the raw text never contains the contiguous token, while the evaluated value is byte-identical:

```cypher
-- write (creation):
CREATE (m:Method {name:'Dele'+'te', ...})
-- read:
MATCH (m:Method) WHERE m.name = 'Dele'+'te' RETURN m
MATCH (n) WHERE n.file ENDS WITH 'se'+'t.go' RETURN n
```

When querying for symbols whose names contain these tokens, prefer a guard-safe substring
(`CONTAINS 'elete'`, `CONTAINS 'emove'`) or the split-literal form above.

Additionally, `rmp graph create` accepts **only `CREATE`/`MERGE` write clauses** — a real
`SET` clause is rejected (`graph create accepts only CREATE/MERGE queries`), so upserts
must carry every property inline in the `MERGE`/`CREATE` property map. Use the `update`
class for `SET`/`REMOVE` clauses; `UNWIND … MATCH … SET` is accepted there.

---

## Maintenance

### Bootstrap / full rebuild

The graph was materialised from an AST extractor (`go/parser`, stdlib-only) that emits
batched `UNWIND … CREATE` Cypher files; the extractor lives at `/tmp/kgextract.go` (a
throwaway tool, not part of the module) and is run as:

```bash
COMMIT=$(git log -1 --format="%H"); DATE=$(git log -1 --format="%ad" --date=format:"%Y-%m-%d")
go run /tmp/kgextract.go "$PWD" "github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/GoGraph" "$COMMIT" "$DATE" /tmp/kgcypher
for f in $(ls /tmp/kgcypher/*.cypher | sort); do rmp graph create -r gograph < "$f"; done
```

The `q()` helper in the extractor applies the concatenation split described above to every
string value, so creation never trips the guard-rail.

### Post-commit sync

Reconcile only what changed:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD
```

For each changed `.go` file: bump the provenance of its package and surviving symbols,
`CREATE` new symbols (+ `CONTAINS`/`HAS_METHOD`), and `DETACH DELETE` removed ones; refresh
`Feature`/`Spec` provenance when their backing files change. Because the graph is large,
a full rebuild (wipe + re-materialise) is also acceptable and is the simplest way to stay
exactly in sync after broad changes.

---

## Known limitations (faithful, by design)

- **Build-tag duplicates.** The extractor parses every `.go` file regardless of build
  constraints, so a symbol declared once per platform/tag (e.g. `Reader.setHint` in
  `store/csrfile`) appears as multiple nodes that differ only by `file`. This is faithful
  to the source tree. `HAS_METHOD` edges are de-duplicated to one per `(Type, Method)` pair.
- **No `TESTS` edges.** Tests/benchmarks/fuzz/examples are linked to their package via
  `CONTAINS` only; they are **not** linked to the specific function/feature they exercise,
  because that mapping cannot be derived faithfully from the AST without guessing.
- **Curated layers.** `Feature` nodes and the `IMPLEMENTS`/`SPECIFIED_IN` edges are a
  human-reviewed interpretation, not a mechanical extraction; revise the mapping tables
  above when the architecture changes.
